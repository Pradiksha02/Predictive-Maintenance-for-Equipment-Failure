Predictive Maintenance for Equipment Failure


🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts potential machine failures using real-time sensor data, helping enable predictive maintenance and reduce unexpected downtime.

📂 Dataset Overview
• Source: Provided for capstone project
• Total records: 944 rows
• Total features: 9 input features + 1 target (fail)
• Target Variable: fail (1 = Failure occurred, 0 = Normal operation)

🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data Loading – Sensor data is read from 'data (1).csv'
2. Exploratory Analysis – Check for nulls, print sample, view heatmap
3. Data Preparation – Features/target split, train-test split
4. Model Training – Random Forest trained on 80% of data
5. Evaluation – Confusion matrix, classification report printed
6. Outputs Saved – predictions.csv, machine_failure_model.pkl
7. Feature Importance – Visualized with bar chart

📈 Model Performance (Example)
